    The <code>jsonurl-core</code> package defines provides classes to parse and 
    generate <a href="https://www.jsonurl.org/">JSON&#x2192;URL</a> text.

    <h2>The Streaming API</h2>    
    The <a href="org/jsonurl/stream/JsonUrlIterator.html">JsonUrlIterator</a>
    interface defines an API for parsing JSON&#x2192;URL text as a sequence of
    <a href="org/jsonurl/stream/JsonUrlEvent.html">events</a>. It may be used
    directly, but more often one of the object model APIs
    (e.g. org.json.j2se, org.json.jsonorg, org.json.jsonp) is used.
  
    <h2><a id="security" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
    <p>The parser is designed to parse untrusted input. It supports limits on
    the number of parsed values and depth of nested arrays or objects. When the
    limit is exceeded a LimitException is thrown. Sane limit values are set by
    default.
