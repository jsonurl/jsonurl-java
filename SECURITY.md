## Reporting a Vulnerability

First: thank you for engaging in responsible disclosure!

If you beleive you've found a vulnerability or other security related issue
please email a complete description to jsonurl.org \`\`at'' gmail.com.
If the issue is accepted a discussion will begin on a private
[Zulip][zulip] channel, and you may be be invited to participate. Once a fix
is in place, and a new release is made, a GitHub security  advisory  will be
created to make the information public.

If the vulnerability is declined a Github issue may still be created,
and/or the Zulip channel may be made public, to make the discussion public
if the repository owners see value in that. Otherwise, we appreciate your
engagement in responsible disclosure and you are now free to disclose
the information (or not) as you see fit.
